Create a brand new code (just kidding, a copy) of the front end, and make a routine:

1. Let the user introduce the names of the places to map
2. Let the user take photos of each place
3. Arrange them on the cnn format
4. Train the network, with several logs in the page (inner html)
5. Export the network as a function on a js format
6. Upload to gitHub
7. Make a page for the actual user, only giving him the js file of the standalone function

Test A LOT :(
